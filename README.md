# pic24f16ka101-firmware-library
A library for a PIC24F chip that was developed over the course of a semester.

Some of the overhead files were provided to be compatible with a PICkit3. There is code in this library to perform various tasks (including programming a Samsung-compatible infrared channel changer). This was the final deliverable: it measures the voltage of a battery and sets off an alarm when it falls below a threshold.
